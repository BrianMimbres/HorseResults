The code in the HorseResults repository is a collection of various attempts to 
muck about with scrapping data from the web, interacting with databases and ORM 
code. 

There is no guarantee that any of it works or even compiles. 
This code is for demonstration and learning purposes only.

All this code could be complete crap.
